About 200/300 words maximum. 
 For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. 
 We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, 
 but without headings: 
 (1) Background: place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 
 (2) Methods: describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 
 (3) Results: summarize the article's main findings; 
 (4) Conclusions: indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. 
 The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, 
 it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.

\section{Introduction}
The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. 
 The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. 
 Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. 
 Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. 
 As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. 
 Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. 
 Now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book1,ref-book2} or other reference types \cite{ref-unpublish,ref-communication,ref-proceeding}. 
 Consider to look at these paper as a reference for writing good papers:
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Partitioned integration and coordination via the self-organising coordination regions pattern
	\item Engineering collective intelligence at the edge with aggregate processes
 \end{itemize}
